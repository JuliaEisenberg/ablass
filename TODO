TODO
====

- Add code to handle deleted sins and sin projects. The should probably still
  stick around and just be marked as deleted in order for donations / sin
  projects to still be able to refer to them later on.
- Add magic icon thingy to allow mobile users to iconize the site on their home
  layout.
- Add integration tests:
  - The use case for a simple sin, including callback.
  - The use case for a detailed sin, including callback.
